# Big JSON in RecyclerView
The idea is to download a big JSON over HTTP GET (JSON size is 8mo and contains 30.000 records).

The images will be downloaded asynchronously during scrolling.

The goal is to test the performances of the most used component in Android.

Used components:
- Android RecyclerView
- Android CardView
- ButterKnife
- Picasso
- Gson
- Android Async Http library
